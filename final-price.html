      <h2>The app was created as a personal challenge to find a practical solution to a real problem. The goal was to complete the project within a deadline of two days.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>When you immigrate to a new country there are a lot of differences and adaptation takes time.
      One common issue that appeared over conversations was that on Canada the price tags do not show the end price
      (tags only show the sale price and taxes are applied on top of it) where in Brazil the tags present the sales price and all taxes included.</p>

      <h3>Understanding the issue</h3>

    <p>After noticing that, I realized this could be an interesting topic and maybe something fun to work at. But how could I Understand the issue and a propose something on only two days? The path chosen was to apply Lean UX and Guerrilla research. I decided to talk to three newcomers and see if the experiences and issues were similar.</p>

    <p>Having the timeline in mind I could not waste time, so I jumped into the conversations, or should I say a ‚ÄúCoffee time‚Äù with the people I new from the newcomer community at Vancouver. The main insights learned from these talks were that ‚Äúbefore sales tax were already given‚Äù, ‚Äúsometimes there are surprises at the end price of a purchase and I need to reprioritize my weekly budget‚Äù, ‚ÄúMost of things are purchased with cash‚Äù and they went physically to the stores.</p>

      <figcaption>Listen, note, ask and validate</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now thinking that the major concern was financial and the second security (carrying bills / not being able to purchase goods) the next setp would be to understand and validate the type of interaction and journey.</p>

    <p>After a second round of discussion (this time via WhatsApp), I discovered that most people go shopping with a smartphone, used both for the list as for communicating with relatives at home. The stores they go are mostly closed spaces (limited natural lightning) and the majority of devices were iPhones.</p>

    <div class="column title-container">
      <span class="eye">figuring it out</span>
      <h2>The solution</h2>
    </div>

    <p>With the previous insight in mind, my goal was to come up with a way to inform folks what would be the total price of a good or the end price of a purchase (Sales + taxes), this way they would be able to make better choices and have some level of help on the initial moments as newcomers.</p>
    <p>Understand taxes was also important, after a bit of desk research, I used cardsorting to come. up with categories that would cover different tax brackets combinations from federal and provincial levels. (my main reference was the government website)</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="" src="src/img/projects/final-price/notes.webp" width="1000" height="100" alt="notes"/>
      <figcaption>Sketches on how the solution could work (sorry, my handwriting is encripted)</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Given devices were iPhones the way to go was to think on an iOS service so I used patterns from HiG to ensure familiarity with the interaction patterns and the context they are when doing groceries, I opted by a dark theme, so it would not only be better to view but also help save battery that could be needed during the commute.</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="" src="src/img/projects/final-price/landing.webp" width="1000" height="100" alt="landing page"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The full range of screens can be viewed below:</p>
    <figure>
      <img class="" src="src/img/projects/final-price/app-screens.webp" width="1000" height="100" alt="screens"/>
    </figure>

    <p>The idea is pretty simple, the user would access the app and either set up a grocery list, similar to a To-Do list where they would be able to copy and use it recurrently or go straight to the calculation using the camera to recognize the price on a given tag. As an edge case, if the camera is not able to recognize the value, the user can manually input the price for the app to calculate the final price (hence the name, Final Price). By changing the category the app would take it in consideration and apply the proper taxes resulting on a new value.</p>
    
    <div class="column title-container">
      <span class="eye">and finally,</span>
      <h2>üéØ The outcomes</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Since this is a concept there are no quantitative results, only qualitative feedback where people were able to use and perceived as ‚ÄúStraightforward‚Äù and ‚Äùsimple yet elegant‚Äù.</p>
    <p>Paths forward on this concept could be to translate it into an hybrid app or conceive a similar android app to broaden user base, conceive a browser extension for online shopping and further on collect usage data to present lowest prices and location for users.</p>
