      <h2>ExxonMobil Product Solutions is one of the largest Oil and Gas companies worldwide.
        At the time the Bazil Business Suport Center was looking for optimizing internal systems.
      </h2>
    </div>

    <p>In Brazil, the maximum work hours are eight hours per day or forty-four hours per week according to the constitution and labor laws.
      Anything beyond this is considered overtime. ExxonMobil implemented the Curitiba Attendance System (CASYS) to ensure work-life balance
      and to only use overtime when necessary. The system was created in the 90s and used employees' smartcards to record their access to the office areas.
      However, due to security concerns, the system is undergoing a redesign project.</p>
      
    <p>We knew about security and technical problems, but we were unaware of any usability issues.
      Some people said the system looked old and unattractive, but we weren't sure if this affected its usability.
    </p>
      
    <div class="highlight">
      <span class="highlight-title">The challenge</span>
      <p>
        We needed to understand if beyond technical debt there were usability concerns or if people just didn't like how it looked.

      <span class="eye">acting on it</span>
      <h2>The solution</h2>
    </div>

    <p>To structure a quick research plan, I relied on a Certitude-Supposition-Doubt (CSD) Matrix, with that I was able to categorize all the knowledge
      as a "truth" or certitude, points of discussion as suppositions and unknowns into doubts. Based on this matrix I designed a script for a round of
      interviews with users.</p>

    <h3>Research and discovery</h3>

    <p>Those interviews uncovered two different interaction models, that were the foundation for the personas, as per the table below:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Reviewer</th>
          <th>Employee</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Roles</td>
          <td>Managers, Supervisors, Administrative assistants and team-leads</td>
          <td>Analysts, all employees under labor law contract without a clause of trust on their contract.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Actions</td>
          <td>Reviews all time entries for each employee of their team. Signs the documentation and is responsible for its stewardship.</td>
          <td>Inputs data and review entries before submitting it for external review.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Expectations</td>
          <td>Need to review it in a timely fashion and do not want to waste time with this kind of activity, perceives it as a low-value task.</td>
          <td>Only uses because it is a mandate. Do not see any value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Frustrations</td>
          <td>"Reviewing all employees takes to much time." /
            "I need to analyze 30 days to find 1 or 2 exceptions, the system should be able to do that." / 
            "After approving, my employees need to print, sign, then I have to sign, digitalize and store it."</td>
          <td>"Using it is a waste of time" / 
            "The system is always down"/ 
            "Alway copy and pasting data"</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Without quantitative data, it was important to observe how people used the system. This was done through guerrilla usability sessions where employees were asked to perform common actions while a peer took notes. Several pain points were identified, including the system's failure to capture floor entries, default values being ignored, a lack of error treatment, no indication of attention points to reviewers, and a heavy reliance on manual tasks and paper.</p>

    <h3>New experience for employees</h3>

    <p>The new design aimed to show all important information at once, allowing employees to quickly see their hour balance to determine if
      they needed to report overtime. They could also easily see all days and navigate to specific dates if necessary.
      The three most important features of the design were:</p>

      <h4>1. Automation of data entry</h4>

      <p>Before, the system would prompt times to 08:00am, 12:00pm, 01:00pm and 05:00pm as the default entries for the day.
        That demanded from users to manually correct dates to match the correct timing. With the new system, users could set their default
        entry and leave time and CASYS would automatically pick the closest available value.
        With this change, users now only checked the time instead of track it elsewhere.</p>

        <h4>2. Integration with docusign and reporting software</h4>

      <p>With the new integrations, users would not have to print and sign the reports, that was be made by a single click.
        Reporting overtime also became automatic and employees did not had to double entry the data into different systems.</p>

        <h4>3. Updates on user interface</h4>

        <p>The new interface was more aligned with HR new guidelines and also was conceived using EM Unity design system,
          so developers would not have to customize components.</p>

      </figure>

    <h3>New experience for reviewers</h3>
  
    <p>
      Instead of reviewing all the data, the system now only highlighted potential exceptions.
      Also there was automation between employees and reviewers once an employee submitted the report, the reviewer now received a notification.
      When approving or rejecting, the employee would be notified, this reduced lead time between actions from each part.
