      <h2>Videnci is a Brazilian startup that offers B2B SaaS solutions to automate work routines by migrating checklists and workflows from paper to the cloud.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>As a product and design manager at Videnci, my goal was to optimize my team's performance and minimize their workload.
      I proposed a unified ecosystem of component libraries that were coded based on design semantics and centralized style management.
      This would simplify the design process and reduce refactoring work for both designers and developers by breaking it down into smaller components.</p>

    <p>Before, the company prioritized graphic design over maintenance and usability, resulting in inconsistencies throughout the products and site.
      There were redundancies in styles, misuse of components, and miscommunication between design mockups and Vuetify's components.
      In total, there were over 750 CSS files, including frameworks, custom, and imported files. Below is a quick analysis of the main file.</p>

    <h3>Analysis results of the main CSS file</h3>

    <p>In summary, each developer had created their own set of rules for each snippet they had worked on over the years.</p>

      <h2>The solution</h2>
    </div>

    <p>I wish I could say there was a simple solution to mitigate over three years of accumulated technical debt. In our case, we chose to start implementing best practices on upcoming releases of the dev team, start a style sanitization and componentization on the design team.</p>

    <p>To ensure alignment between deliverables from different designers, I enforced a centralized library, we ran design reviews for each new token and component to be sure those could be applied on different contexts. This style of management generated an initial overhead but it scaled very fast, in less than two months all designers were using the shared components, and delivery to dev was fluid, around a day for each task.</p>

      <figcaption>Example of token categories defined for palettes</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>We had two main libraries to maintain, a Vuetify one for the Vue hybrid app and another in plain CSS for the WordPress-based website. The plan was to have a single JSON library and use Salesforce's Theo for transpiling the styles for each platform, but this part was not implemented.</p>

    <p>By thinking on an agnostic system that used an inheritance model between tokens, components, team components, and system components, we were able to simplify exponentially our front-ends. This refactoring of our structure allowed the designers to spend less time on Figma and more time understanding the needs of our customers and developers to spend less time tracking and applying changes and focusing on more engineering quality.</p>
