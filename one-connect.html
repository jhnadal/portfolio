      <h2>ExxonMobil Product Solutions is one of the largest chemical companies worldwide. At the time they were looking how to develop a digital first business model</h2>
    </div>

    <p>
      Digital transformation and keeping up with an ever-changing market is a concern for many traditional companies, including ExxonMobil Product Solutions.
      We wanted to understand what this change meant for the business, the customers, and the market. As we pondered these questions, we found ourselves asking,
      "Where is the business going? What are the things we know? What are the things we don't?" It was a fuzzy moment, with no guide or existing route for answers.
    </p>
      
        <div class="column title-container">
          <span class="eye">First step</span>
          <h2>Ask Around, what are people thinking?</h2>
        </div>  
        

      <p>We started with desk research and realized that our company was heavily reliant on tools and always looked for the next big tool to solve our problems.
        That was the first piece of the puzzle.
        Next, we interviewed our internal stakeholders and discovered that our customer service process was unfriendly and bureaucratic.
        Everything was mediated by an agent, resulting in long queues.</p>
    
      <figure>
        <img class="" src="src/img/projects/one-connect/process.webp" width="1000" height="600" alt="examples of tokens"/>
        <figcaption>Example of a previous order placement process.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>During our customer interviews, we discovered two opposing experiences. From 9 to 5, customers would request orders through email, phone, or attempt to log into our frequently unavailable online product. But after work, they could easily place orders on online marketplaces with just one tap. We called this the "Amazon experience".</p>

      <p>Since B2B and B2C products were different in 2017, we weren't sure how this difference would affect our business. Stakeholders suggested features such as "1 click order" to have trucks available at customer plants. But would this experience be the same for customers in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia?</p>

      <p>After the second round of interviews and exploration, we began to understand what each stakeholder was looking for.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Stakeholders</th>
            <th>Customers</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Optimize the internal work.</td>
            <td>Have more information and status about their orders.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Reduce waiting times.</td>
            <td>Do not have to provide the same information for both internal and external systems.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Have a highly available system.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Most customers placed orders for the whole year at the same time, they expected an easier way for doing so.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

    <p>Those insights were critical to us and with that information we started crafting a one-stop shop to automate and simplify every customer service action. We made all the information we could available for customers (regulatory documents, technical sheets, specifications, open orders, order history, place/change/cancel orders, reports, and open suggestions and complaints) so EM Chemical would be able to provide faster and better responses.</p>

      <div class="column title-container">
        <span class="eye">Using the data</span>
        <h2>Designing a solution</h2>
      </div> 
        
        
        <p>We wanted to deliver a valuable solution without risking a delayed delivery of our complex product.
          To determine the value and prioritize our scope, we mediated a new round of conversations and used card sorting to understand our customers'
          mental models and find low-hanging fruits. The results of these sessions were:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Order Placement</li>
          <li>Order history</li>
          <li>Regulatory documents</li>
          <li>Track orders</li>
          <li>Open requests</li>
        </ol>

        <p> To move and learn quickly, we created low-fidelity prototypes and discussed them with internal support staff.
          After assessing changes with developers, we conducted online usability sessions with customers to validate our assumptions and propositions.
          Our prototypes quickly evolved into high fidelity, thanks to our UI effort of componentization.
        </p>

        <h2>Order placement</h2>
        <div class="gallery two">
        <figure>
          <img class="" src="src/img/projects/one-connect/ocs-1.webp" width="500" height="350" alt="OCS main screen"/>
          <figcaption>Previous tool was dated, with low availability for customers.</figcaption>

          <img class="" src="src/img/projects/one-connect/ocs-2.webp" width="500" height="350" alt="image of product selection on OCS"/>
          <figcaption>Interactions were heavily reliant on dropdowns and memorization of internal codes.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
        </div>
          Although the previous product allowed order placement, it was difficult for customers to use, especially for new ones, because they had to
          memorize internal codes for shipping methods, products, combinations of products, packages, and shipping methods.
          To improve this, we designed our product with three guiding principles in mind:
        </p>
        <h3>Clarity</h3>
        <p>
          We made sure that the information was clear and easily accessible.
          We used visual principles to create a clear hierarchy, white spaces to guide the reading, and proper contrast for visibility.
        </p>
        <h3>Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          We broke down complex processes into smaller steps to make the product more efficient.
          We also made sure that the behavior and states of the components were designed to prevent errors and ensure user efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>Consistency</h3>
        <p>
          We made sure that each screen, grid, and component followed the same set of rules to provide a consistent experience for the user.
        </p>

        <figcaption>Once an order is placed, the system provides all of the information in a single location, the customer can access the order details, delivery information, technical documents, and also edit, cancel or reorder.</figcaption>
      </figure>
        <h2>Order Cancellation and permanent actions</h2>

        <p>When dealing with actions that have permanent effects, such as order cancellations, we provided a dedicated context to minimize mistakes and added an active request.
          We also used these moments to gather information and improve the business process.
        </p>
