      <h2>TELUS is a leading Telecom company in Canada aiming for more consistency across its digital experiences.</h2>
    </div>

    <p>TELUS had already created Design Systems, but only for a single brand's websites.
      As the design knowledge grew, they wanted a system that could cover more products and support an omnichannel business model.
      To accomplish this, they created the Universal Design System (UDS) in late 2019. The goal was to have one library for all TELUS brands (including Koodo and Public Mobile) on any platform (Android, iOS, and Web).
      This would allow for consistency in guidelines, standards, styles, and components.</p>
      
    <p>The intention was good and the idea had lots of potential, however, some practical aspects were not fully considered, confusing the product's direction. After two years of struggles
        and low adoption rates, new members were onboarded and we were allowed to re-assess UDS and help the company.</p>
      
    <div class="highlight">
      <span class="highlight-title">The challenge</span>
      <p>While UDS was a powerful product, it suffered from unnecessary complexity and difficulty in maintenance, leading to people not understanding how to use it, hence not using it.
        As a result, I reviewed the product vision and strategy, and rallied the team to shift their focus towards providing a more user-friendly platform for our customers.</p>
    </div>

    <p>To simplify UDS, we talked to designers and developers at TELUS delivery teams to understand what they needed and wanted.
      Based on their feedback, we improved the developer experience by making documentation easily accessible and providing regular updates on component use.
      We also created an open Slack community for anyone interested in learning more about UDS.</p>

    <p>Next, we gathered input from each brand design team to understand their goals and current offerings. We found that each brand was going in its own direction focused only on designing screens on Figma
      without considering their feasibility or best practices</p>

    <p>To structure the system, we focused on "base components," reusable code snippets that could be branded using two data layers: "palettes" and "themes."
      Each brand was given a palette and a theme, with the brand palette containing design tokens to represent brand identity, and the themes serving as the interfaces between the palettes and the components.
      In other words, the palettes contained design options, and the themes represented the design decisions for each component.</p>

    <figcaption>Example of token categories defined for palettes</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We started by reviewing the 60 existing components and defining their states, interactions, properties, and variants.
      This helped us understand what each component should and should not do, and we enforced a common structure and rules across all brands.
      We repeated this process for the 26 new components we created. Let's take the button component as an example.</p>

    <figcaption>Structure for the buttons component, states, and variants (size, priority, danger). </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>To design the buttons component, we analyzed the problems the community was trying to solve with it to defined its structure, requirements, and specifications.
      After several cycles, we decided the button could be customized using the following tokens: <i>alignSelf, backgroundColor, borderColor, borderRadius, borderRadius, borderWidth, color, fontName, fontSize, fontWeight, icon, iconSize, iconSpace, lineHeight, minWidth, opacity, outerBackgroundColor, outerBorderColor, outerBorderGap, outerBorderWidth, paddingBottom, paddingLeft, paddingRight, paddingTop, shadow, textAlign, textLine, textLineStyle and width.</i>
      
      We also defined interaction states, rules depending on the platform, and variants like <i>Default, Hover, Pressed, Focus, Focus and Pressed, Inactive, danger </i>(for destructive patterns that lead to loss of information), <i>inverse</i> (for darker backgrounds), <i>priority</i> (to define visual hierarchy of interactions), <i>size</i> (to control the size of the label and button) and <i>width</i> for full-width use-cases.</p>

    <p>With these tokens and variables defined, we were able to discuss themes and palettes with the brands. We defined a shared naming convention and rules so teams working across brands could create multi-brand experiences without surprises. Brands could customize existing the components based on the available tokens or request new ones to further customize the component.</p>

      <span class="eye">Taking a step further</span>
      <h2>Community contribution</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The proposed changes and standardization were successful, but the team of 8 people couldn't maintain all the standards for every brand and support any new brand needs. The solution was to invite community contribution.</p>

    <p>Instead of having one team responsible for all component changes, the core team would support the base components, palettes, and themes for TELUS, Koodo, and Public Mobile.
      Other teams could contribute specific components or extend themes for brand-specific variants. They could even request a new theme or palette for a specific need.</p>
